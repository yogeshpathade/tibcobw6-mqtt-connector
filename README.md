# TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks 6 Plugin for MQTT

This plugin is developed using TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks Plug-in Development Kit 6.1.0
with TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks 6.2.1.

Please note that the MQTT plugin uses eclipse paho 1.0.2 java client library and it is only tested 
on the mosquitto MQTT broker. 

The plugin is not completely tested and lacks some support of error handling.
The online help document, installer and the update site is still in works. I will add more details
soon.
